## Hey there! 👋 I'm Manasa! 🚀  

Welcome to my GitHub—where code, chaos, and caffeine collide! ☕💻  

### 🔥 About Me  
- 🧑‍💻 Full Stack Developer (MERN) | JavaScript Enthusiast  
- 🎨 Frontend Fanatic (React, Custom CSS, and a sprinkle of Bootstrap)  
- 🛠️ Backend Tinkerer (Node.js, Express, MongoDB)  
- 🔍 Currently fixing my **Weather Forecast App** (because weather predictions should be more reliable than my code on the first try!)  
- 🌱 Always learning something new (Next.js, TypeScript… someday, I promise! 😆)  
- 🏆 Mission: **Write clean code, break things, fix them, repeat!**  

### 🎯 What You'll Find Here  
✅ Side projects that started as "quick ideas" and turned into "never-ending refactors"  
✅ Random experiments (because curiosity never killed this dev!)  
✅ A sprinkle of **README files longer than the actual code** 😆  

### 💡 Fun Facts  
- 🚀 Deploying on Vercel & Render because… why not?  
- 🎮 Built an interactive Clicker Game because debugging wasn’t stressful enough  
- ☁️ Fixing my Weather Forecast App, so now you can blame me if it rains unexpectedly!  
- 🐱 More commits at night because daylight debugging is overrated
